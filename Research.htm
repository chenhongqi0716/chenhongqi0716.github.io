        <b> On the Analyisis of Quantile Forward Regression </b> <br>
        <i> Abstract: </i> In this paper, we study the theoretical properties of K-step and t-threshold quantile forward regressions in a linear quantile regression model with high-dimensional covariates. The model under our investigation is assumed potentially misspecified and we consider the best sparse approximation using quantile forward regressions. We provide non-asymptotic prediction bounds for both methods, and show asymptotic convergence results and the asymptotic efficacy of K-step quantile forward regression. In our asymptotic framework, we allow the number of covariates and the number of steps to diverge at different rates with the sample size. We demonstrate superior finite sample performance of quantile forward regressions to commonly-used penalization methods in terms of prediction accuracy and variable selection through extensive Monte Carlo simulations. We illustrate the usage of quantile forward regressions by two empirical applications: growth-at-risk forecasting and testing the convergence hypothesis of international economic growth. <br>

        <b> A Variable Screening Approach for Growth-at-Risk Prediction </b> (with Ji Hyung Lee) <br>
        <i> Abstract: </i> This paper investigates a variable screening approach to study growth-at-risk (GaR) forecasting
            with high-dimensional predictors. Unlike the existing studies focusing on a few predictors,
            we use a high-dimensional Fred-QD dataset that can retain useful information on GaR forecasting.
            To do this, we refine and extend the quantile partial correlation (QPC) based variable
            screening method by Ma, Li, and Tsai (2017) so that the method can employ time series data.
            A set of Monte Carlo simulations confirms the validity of QPC under weak dependence, and
            the empirical application on variable selection for GaR forecasting illustrates the benefit of the
            method. Some labor market factors are shown to be particularly useful in predicting GaR. <br>

        <b> Inference on Linear Quantile Regression with Dyadic Data </b>
            <a href="/papers/dyadicQR.pdf"> [pdf] </a> <br>
        <i> Abstract: </i> In this paper, we study a robust inference procedure for linear quantile regression estimator
            with a dyadic data structure. We derive asymptotic distribution for quantile regression estimator
            when there exists dependence between any pair of dyads with common nodes in a network. We
            provide consistency results for the covariance matrix estimator and show asymptotic normality
            for the corresponding t-statistic. Numerical simulations are provided to illustrate the good
            performance of our t-statistic in the inference of quantile regression with dyadic data. <br>

        <b>Forecasting Growth-at-Risk with Many Predictors: a Quantile Random Forests Approach </b> (with Ji Hyung Lee) <br>
        <i> Abstract: </i> This paper investigates growth-at-risk (GaR) forecasting with high-dimensional predictors. Unlike
            other studies focusing on a few predictors, we use a high-dimensional Fred-QD dataset that can retain
            useful information on GaR forecasting. We compare our GaR forecasts based on quantile random forests
            with other methods such as traditional quantile regression, l1-penalized quantile regression, and GARCH
            model forecasts. Our results suggest that quantile random forests can provide an improved prediction.
            Following Adrian et al. (2019), the evolution of skewed-t distributional forecasts of GaR is also provided. <br>
